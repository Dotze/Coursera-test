    <h1>The Evolution of The bicycle</h1>
    <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster. Evolution of the 
        bicycle began when in 1839 Kirkpatrick Macmillan invented the Macmillan Velocipede bicycle with pedals. It was a huge difference
         from all other bicycles. Pedals were mounted to the rear wheel. </p>
    <p class="example">‚óè The first bike was invented in 1790 by Frenchmen Comte Mede de Sivrac. It was the Celerifere bicycle and it is the earliest 
        two-wheeler. It had no pedals, had a seat, rigid wooden frame, and two wheels. It is like a bike for a child as the rider
         needed to power the bike forward by using the feet.</p>
    <p>The Draisine bicycle was created by Baron Karl von Drais in 1817. The bicycle had two wheels, but still no pedals, so the rider
         still needed to push it with his feet. The steering wheel appeared in this bicycle version. It has become a forerunner of the 
         modern bicycle. This type of bicycle also was being used as the rail vehicle</p>
